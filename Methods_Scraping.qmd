### Scraping

#### Exploration and Technical Challenges

The HuggingFace Open Leaderboard presents benchmark data in a dynamic table embedded within an iframe. Initial exploration revealed that the
table displays only 28 models by default, requiring either scrolling or search filtering to access additional entries. Since automated scrolling
proved unreliable, the solution adopted URL-based filtering via `?search=[model_name]` parameters.
Another option would have been to use the search bar element. However, the complexe implemention of said element and its client-server interaction made itsuse too difficult for us.

#### Implementation and Structure

The final implementation employs an HFLeaderboardScraper class developed using Selenium and BeautifulSoup, with support for multiple browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Through its main method, `scrape_models()`, the scraper systematically navigates the DOM hierarchy — locating the relevant iframe, switching context, and extracting data from standard HTML table elements (<thead>, <tbody>, <tr>, <p>, etc.). It incorporates both dynamic and static waiting strategies, along with validation steps to correctly handle cases where models are absent from the leaderboard or where duplicate entries may appear due to similar model names. To avoid stale element references and session-related issues caused by the dynamic filtering mechanism, the scraper initializes a unique driver instance at each iteration of the loop, ensuring a smooth and stable execution process.

Remarks: The scraping of HuggingFace website is totally allowed as there is no `robot.txt` file mentioned.

#### Output and Integration

Data is appended to CSV incrementally during scraping, preventing data loss from runtime errors. 
The resulting dataset shares a common identifier
(`Model`/`modelId`) with the API-collected metadata, enabling straightforward merging for downstream analysis.
