### Scraping

#### Exploration and Technical Challenges
The HuggingFace Open Leaderboard presents benchmark data in a dynamic table embedded within an iframe. Initial exploration revealed that the
table displays only 28 models by default, requiring either scrolling or search filtering to access additional entries. Since automated scrolling
proved unreliable, the solution adopted URL-based filtering via `?search=[model_name]` parameters.

#### Implementation and Structure
The final implementation uses a `HFLeaderboardScraper` class built with Selenium, supporting multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
The scraper navigates the DOM hierarchy systematically: locating the iframe, switching context, and extracting data from standard HTML table
elements (`<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tr>`, `<p>`). Model names, stored as links (`<a>` tags), require separate extraction and insertion at the
correct position.

Two key methods handle the scraping process: `scrape_header()` extracts column names once and writes them to CSV, while `scrape_models()`
iterates through a model list, filtering the leaderboard for each entry and extracting the top search result. To ensure reliability, the driver
reinitializes for each model and includes `time.sleep()` delays for complete page loading—a pragmatic solution that prioritizes stability over
speed.

#### Output and Integration
Data is appended to CSV incrementally during scraping, preventing data loss from runtime errors. Models without benchmark data are automatically
skipped, though some duplicates occur when similar model variants appear in search results. The resulting dataset shares a common identifier
(`Model`/`modelId`) with the API-collected metadata, enabling straightforward merging for downstream analysis.
